## About

This is the frontend for my Print Shop e-commerce site built using ReactJS. The end goal is to allow users to upload items in the form of STL files (compressed in a  .zip preferably) which can then be ordered by customers and printed by me. Currently, the functionality allows users to create an account and upload items, however, there is no purchase ability, nor the connection between item and user account.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS
- Bootstrap 5
- React Router
- React Context
- React Cookies
- Axios

## Future Developments

As mentioned in the about, this is meant to become a fully fleshed e-commerce site. I would like to specific user authentication that connects the items uploaded with the user who did the uploading. Additionally, purchase functionality including a checkout page and user profile purchases/sales statistics tracking would be needed.
